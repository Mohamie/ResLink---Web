# ResLink---Web
ResLink is an innovative project that integrates a web and mobile application. The project was designed to aid in effective communication within university residences and to counteract inefficient methodologies that were utilized.
The web application serves as the admin module, and was developed using Blazor Server and Backenless Services as backend.
