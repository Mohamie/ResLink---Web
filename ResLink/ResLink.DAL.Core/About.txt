Data Access Layer (DAL)
=======================
The data access layer is responsible for providing an abstraction to the data layer. It makes 
sure that no matter what technology(ies) are used for data persistance, a single entry point 
that is technology agnostic exists.

In this particular application, it references all BL classes.
